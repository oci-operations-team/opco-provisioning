## Using this example
Prepare one variable file named `terraform.tfvars` with the required information (or feel free to copy the contents from `terraform.tfvars.template`).  The contents of `terraform.tfvars` should look something like the following:

```
tenancy_ocid = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
user_ocid = "ocid1.user.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
fingerprint= "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
private_key_path = "~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem"
region = "us-phoenix-1"
default_compartment_ocid = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Then apply the example using the following commands:

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
