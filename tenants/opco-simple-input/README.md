# Template for OPCO Application provisioning - simple input - manual template

In order to provision a new application make a copy of this folder and rename it.

After that edit the configuration files in order to specify the inputs for provisioning your new tenant.

## OCI Credentials

In order to provide the OCI credentials that terraform needs in order to connect to OCI perform the following:

-  Copy under the same folder ```terraform.tfvars.template``` and rename it to ```terraform.tfvars```
-  Edit the ```terraform.tfvars``` file and provide your credentials.

```
### TENANCY DETAILS

# Get this from the bottom of the OCI screen (after logging in, after Tenancy ID: heading)
tenancy_id="<tenancy OCID"
# Get this from OCI > Identity > Users (for your user account)
user_id="<user OCID>"

# the fingerprint can be gathered from your user account (OCI > Identity > Users > click your username > API Keys fingerprint (select it, copy it and paste it below))
fingerprint="<PEM key fingerprint>"
# this is the full path on your local system to the private key used for the API key pair
private_key_path="<path to the private key that matches the fingerprint above>"

# region (us-phoenix-1, ca-toronto-1, etc)
region="<your home region>"
```

## Tenant IAM Compartments Structure

In this template, just as an example, we'll be providing the structure described in the diagram bellow.

![\label{mylabel}](images/CompStructure1.jpg) 

I want to emphasize that this is not limited to this specific structure. You can define your tenant template with any IAM Compartments topology.

In the example structure bellow we have the following IAM Compartments structure:

 - 2nd half of the production level 3:
     - ```cmp-prod-<application-name>``` which is a container for the rest of the application production compartments and it is also a spoke VCN connected to a shared production HUB VCN.
     - ```cmp-stag-<application-name>``` which is a container for the rest of the application staging compartments and it is also a spoke VCN connected to a shared staging HUB VCN.


Edit the ```iam.auto.tfvars```:

#     - <parent_compartment_ocid> with your parent compartment OCID

## Network Security Configuration

We're creating 2 categories of NSGs:
- production NSGs - in this category the user will be able to define a set of NSGs attached to production VCNs
- staging NSGs - in this category the user will be able to define a set of NSGs attached to production VCNs

I want to emphasize that this is not limited to this specific structure. You can define your tenant template with any networking security topology.

- ```app_network_sec_config```:
     - Under the network security you can define multiple NSGs for one of the vcns provisioned during app provisioning
     - You can have multiple elements under the ```app_network_sec_config```

Edit the ```network-security.auto.tfvars``` file:

## Application Monitoring Configuration

We're creating 2 categories of OCI Monitoring events:

- ```cmp-prod-<application_acronym>``` - OCI Events to monitor "*produdction*" resources.
- ```cmp-stag-<application_acronym>``` - OCI Events to monitor only "*staging*" specific resources.

To define events you'll need to provide the following, as part of the ```event_rules``` variable:
 - ```default_compartment_name``` - the compartment to be used if when the ```event_rule``` is defined the ```compartment_name``` is missing.
 - A number of event rules where the ```event_rule``` key will be the ```event_rule``` name
    - ```compartment_name``` - name the of the compartment where the ```event_rule``` will be created
    - ```condition```- the condition that will trigger the event
    - ```description``` - event description
    - ```is_enabled``` - enable or disable the event 
    - ```actions``` : a list of actions to be performed when the event is triggered
        - ```action_type``` - the action type
        - ```is_enabled``` - enable or disable the action
        - ```description``` - action description
        - ```function_id``` - if a calling a function is the action then specify the function ocid
        - ```stream_id``` - if sending a message to a stream is the action then specify stream ocid
        - ```topic_id``` : if sending a message to a notification topic is the action then specify OCI Notification ocid

Search and replace: 
- ```<application_acronym>``` with your application acronym
- ```<ocid-stream-ocid>``` with your OCI Stream OCID

Feel free to replace any other configuration you want.

## State File

- Note that each and every tenant will have its own state file.
- In this example the state file is local but storing it remotelly in a shared location is fully suported.


## Notes/Issues

- Please note that this module contains a deprecated input value: ```projects``` which was used in the past to create sub-structures inside an application. 

## Versions

This module has been developed and tested by running terraform on macOS Monterey Version 12.2.1 

```
$ terraform --version
Terraform v1.1.3
on darwin_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/oci v4.64.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/time v0.7.2

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 1.1.7. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

## Outputs

 - This module is returning both a hierarchical and a flat structure of the:
    - IAM Compartments
    - Network topology
    - Monitoring Configuration

that has been provisioned.

We're exposing both versions as flat is easy to consume by other automations where hierarchical is easy to read by end user.
